Single person; God is looking for a single person<br />
Someone that is wise<br />
Though there are a lot of philosophers on this earth<br />
Those that are <br />
Deep thinkers<br />
That know how to solve the world’s problems, economic questions. Am I right?<br />
But as at this time, the Bible says nobody is wise, even king Solomon is not even wise<br />
Hallelujah. And he was called the wisest person on earth<br />

<b>Bro. Joshua</b>:<br />
<blockquote>

Psalms 130:3-4 New Living Translation (NLT)<br />
<i>
<b>3</b>
Lord, if you kept a record of our sins,who, O Lord, could ever survive?<br />
<b>4</b>
But you offer forgiveness,that we might learn to fear you.
</i><br />
<br />
Thank God for that<br />
If God is keeping record of sins, there is no one that can [survive] <br />
Because we all are sinners before God<br />
Every human being born of a woman is a sinner<br />
Tell someone besides you: you were a sinner before Jesus<br />
<br />
Psalm 13: 1- 2 New Living Translation (NLT)<br />
<i>
<b>1</b> 
O Lord, how long will you forget me? Forever?How long will you look the other way?<br />
<b>2</b>
How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul,with sorrow in my heart every day?How long will my enemy have the upper hand?<br />
</i>
<br />
</blockquote>
<b>Bro Joshua</b>: <br />
<blockquote>
Who is this enemy, the one with this upper hand?  <br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<b>Mrs. Nike</b>:<br /> 
<blockquote>Sin</blockquote><br />
<b>Bro Joshua</b>: <br />
<blockquote>
Sin that has the upper hand. And David was crying telling God <br />
How come I can not just [overcome] this?<br />
Why is this enemy having this upper hand? <br />
<br />
And when you translate that to the person very close. Who is the person, that has upper hand over him?<br />
</blockquote>
<br />

<b>Mrs Busayo</b>: <blockquote>Flesh</blockquote>
<br />
<b>Bro. Joshua</b>:
<blockquote>
Your flesh is the number one, highest enemy<br />
<br />
If you know what I passed through before I determined that I will come [today]<br />
I called everybody and they said no<br />
Before [someone] later called me, I already overcome it<br />
<br />
Praise the Lord. David struggled with it<br />
He struggled. We know what happened to him<br />
<br />
But he cried to God. Why is this enemy having upper hand?<br />
May we overcome that flesh in the name of Jesus<br />
<br />
Let’s read 1 John 1:7<br />
<i>
<b>7</b> But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. (KJV)<br />
</i>
<br />
That is the end of the first outline. Is there anyone with question or contribution? <br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<b>Mr Yinka</b>: <blockquote>Why is man naturally wicked? Why did God create man [to be] naturally wicked?</blockquote><br />
<br />
<b>Mrs. Busayo</b>: <blockquote>It is mainly based on selfish desires. &ltI know&gt we might have inherited it, but … </blockquote><br />
<br />
<b>Mrs. Niri</b>: <blockquote>I do not think I am wicked. Abraham [is righteous]. He who was discussing with God about [delivering some] from the land of Sodom</blockquote>
<br />
<b>Bro Joshua</b>
<blockquote>
I have not knowingly harmed anyone in my life, yet the Bible says I am wicked.<br />
<br />
The answer is in Romans 3: 23-26<br />
<br />
<i>
<b>23</b> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br />
<b>24</b> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:<br />
<b>25</b> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br />
<b>26</b> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. (KJV)<br />
</i>
<br />

 The B part of “Man is naturally wicked” says that the sin of the whole world was such a burden, that even the Almighty Jesus groan under it. <br />
<br />
And if we check the record of Jesus.<br />
<br />
According to Bible, he is the only one that is not born though human connection. <br />
He only came from that woman and the Bible says he is the only one that is righteous. <br />
<br />
But when he bore our sins, the Bible says he groaned. <br />
He went through pain, agony because of my sin and your sin <br />
<br />
Let me read. When man is at his best, he is like rag before God <br />
<br />
This is before God, not human being. We human being will give you position  <br />

<b>Bro Ubah</b>:
<blockquote>
As christians fall into one temptation or the other. <br />
But you see what his friends, who are his close friends.<br />
But before [anything], We are friends to each other.<br />
[Someone] condemned him [Job] immediately<br />
And he was condemning him because he was telling that what [befell] him<br />
- and I’m trying to say how wicked men [are] - <br />
for us to understand; the reason why we are reading this is <br />
the way we feel, the way we talk about things, the way we take things personal, the way we react  <br />
when certain situations happen to people shows how [vain-knowledge] we are<br />
How we have knowledge without any context in us <br />

<br />
So Job’s friends - you see- they first of all accused him that it is because of his sin <br />
That thing happened to him<br />
And the second one - they accused him again <br />
Because they said that yes, you are a very stubborn person<br />
Which we do most times<br />
[We are very stubborn persons] and [we] are arrogant <br />
<br />
Then after everything, <br />
<br />
Then when I was studying this, I realized how many of us <br />
[do it happily]<br />
<br />
If something happens to somebody<br />
Maybe somebody has money before, and [now] he doesn’t have money<br />
We will start judging the person<br />
<br />
So that [judgment] we are displaying, it is [an act] of wickedness <br />
<br />

And I pray that God will help us.<br />
Because when I was reading this<br />
I picked that point<br />
And I took it to be a lesson to even correct myself<br />
Praise the Lord<br />
That is exactly what I wanted to bring out<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<b>Bro. Joshua</b>:<br />
<blockquote> 
Thank you very much Bro. Ubah<br />
Okay. <br />
So do not judge anybody<br />
Even though Job [and]<br />
His Friends were wrong from the beginning <br />
[Both] of them <br />
<br />
Job [is saying] something different<br />
His friend [is saying] something different <br />
[So] all of them were wrong<br />
<br />
[Eli] the youngest among them<br />
Opened their eyes<br />
To the Glory of God<br />
